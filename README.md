# Holy-Warriors
Faith can drive people forward. With faith, you can either found the best suited religion and spread it all over the world or build your Holy Warriors that is second to none.  
All military units before the Information era (except Scout & Carrier) are unbuildable and can ONLY be purchased with Faith.
